# Event-Finder-Web-Application

In this project, I have created a webpage using Angular and node.js that allows you to search for event information using the Ticketmaster API, and the results will be displayed in a tabular format. The page will also provide event and venue details. Currently hosted the website using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Outcome
- Developed a web page using Flask that interfaces with the Ticketmaster API to retrieve event information based on user search input.
- Improved event search functionality by integrating Google Maps and IPinfo.io geocoding APIs. Incorporated a search radius and real-time user location tracking to provide more relevant results.
- Demonstrated proficiency in full-stack web development and API integration.

## How to run?

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.1.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
